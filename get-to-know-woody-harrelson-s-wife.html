The couple has been together for over 30 years but they have been married as husband and wife for 14 years.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Woody gained popularity for his role as Woody Boyd in the comedy series Cheers. He had actually met his future wife Laura Louie while shooting the series. Woody went on to star in numerous motion pictures like Regular Born Killers, Zombieland, The Hunger Games series, and Presently You See Me series to mention but a few. All through his career, Laura was beside him first as an assistant, then partner, wife, and finally the mother of their three beautiful daughters.</p><p>Laura along with her husband are staunch vegans and practical environmentalists. While Laura’s entrepreneurial spirit thrives in her growing eco-based empire, her compassion and maturity is evident in how she handles her marriage despite the many challenges she faces as the wife of a celebrity. As a wife, mother, entrepreneur, and philanthropist who flies under the radar, she is more than just Woody Harrelson’s wife, she is his better half and the woman behind his success.</p><h3><strong>Laura Louie’s Profile Summary</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name</strong>: Laura Louie</li><li><strong>Gender</strong>: Female</li><li><strong>Year of Birth</strong>: 1965</li><li><strong>Place of Birth</strong>: Hawaii, United States of America</li><li><strong>Laura Louie’s Age</strong>: 58 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity</strong>: Asian-American</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: American</li><li><strong>Education</strong>: Degree in Business Management and Environmental Science</li><li><strong>Profession</strong>: Entrepreneur and Philanthropist</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong>: Straight</li><li><strong>Marital Status</strong>: Married</li><li><strong>Laura Louie’s Husband</strong>: Woodrow Tracy Harrelson (m. 2008)</li><li><strong>Laura Louie’s Children</strong>: Zoe Giordano Harrelson, Makani Ravello Harrelson, Deni Montana Harrelson</li><li><strong>Laura Louie’s Height in Inches</strong>: 5 feet, 7 inches</li><li><strong>Laura Louie’s Height in Centimetres</strong>: 170.18 cm</li><li><strong>Laura Louie’s Weight</strong>: 63 kg (138 lbs)</li><li><strong>Body Measurements in Inches</strong>: 34-24-35</li><li><strong>Laura Louie’s Net Worth</strong>: $3 million</li><li><strong>Famous for</strong>: Being Woody Harrelson’s wife</li><li><strong>Twitter</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>@thegreengod</a></li><li><strong>Company’s website</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>voiceyourself.com</a></li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Laura Louie?</strong></h2><p>Laura Louie is 58 years old in 2023. She was born in 1965 to an Asian family in Hawaii, United States of America.</p><p>Other than the fact that her parents are fully Asian, we do not know any more about her birth and background. As for her education, she did go to university and graduated with a degree in business management and environmental sciences. Her degree has no doubt helped greatly with her business and passion for protecting the environment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/ac4b791feb7a7770.jpg><h2><strong>The Onset of Laura Louie and Woody Harrelson’s Relationship Was Dramatic</strong></h2><p>Laura met Woody Harrelson on the set of Cheers, Woody who was gradually becoming famous for his role in the series had casually asked “Hey, does anybody here have secretarial skills? ‘Cause I could really use an assistant. Laura Louie, who was just 22 at that time, raised her hand. She was visiting the set with a media workshop from UCLA. In fact, she had taken the place of a student who fell sick and couldn’t be part of the team. It seems their meeting was destined to happen after all.</p><p>Laura then became Woody’s assistant after an interview with the actor at his place in Marina del Rey. Recalling the interview, Woody says: “We had one of the greatest conversations I ever had, so she became my assistant. She was so great that every other person in Cheers got an assistant after that. She became my assistant the day after I met her and for the next three years.”</p><p>Woody Harrelson <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">struggled with his feelings</a> for Laura as he wasn’t ready to admit that he was falling for her. However, when he went to Kenya for Christmas three years later, he found himself ‘fantasising’ about her. On getting back to L.A, and against the advice of his friends, he expressed his feelings to her via a song he wrote. Some lines of the song go thus; “I’m just 28, yet I’m exhausted with all that I do/I don’t have anything when I’m not close to you, will you consider me, baby? Cause I’m considering you”.</p><h3><strong>They Dated for 20 Years Before Becoming Husband and Wife</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/woody-harrelson-kids-1.png><p>Laura, who understood that the song was meant for her, also confessed saying; “Woody, I’ve been in love with you for the last two and a half years,” and thus began their relationship. The two dated for 20 years before officially tying the knot on December 28, 2008, in a very small ceremony near Harrelson’s home in Kipahulu, Maui.</p><p>The very <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>simple wedding</a> cost around $500, with Woody saying; “I have found, the least expensive things can be the most personally rewarding. Take my wedding. We didn’t feel the need to shell out a ton of cash and do anything over the top. It was basically just a bunch of good friends getting together in Maui.” The wedding was attended by celebrities like Owen Wilson, Sean Penn, and Willie Nelson. Canadian artist and multi-instrumentalist Alanis Morisette graced the occasion with his beautiful melodies.</p><h2><strong>How Laura Louie’s Marriage Survived Woody Harrelson’s Cheating Scandal</strong></h2><p>Before meeting and dating Laura Louie, Woody Harrelson didn’t believe in the concept of marriage. This isn’t surprising as he himself never had an idea of what a healthy, committed relationship should look like as his father abandoned the family and his mom raised him and his brothers alone. Prior to his relationship with Laura, Woody Harrelson was known as a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>serial womanizer</a> and was even nicknamed “Wicked Woody.” In 1985, he even got married to Neil Simon’s daughter, Nancy Simon. The couple divorced after 10 months, although the marriage was claimed to be a result of a joke that turned sour.</p><p>However, all these changed when he met Laura. As far as we know, Woody has not stepped out on his wife until the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>foursome scandal</a> that happened in 2002. On a trip to London in 2002, Woody claimed that two women came up to him in a bar and they left the bar with another girl whom she didn’t even know was with them. It turned out that the last girl was a journalist who convinced the others to blackmail him and the news of his foursome soon hit the tabs.</p><p>Although he was hoping Laura never found out about the scandal, she somehow got to know and though she was upset, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Laura forgave</a> Woody after he ‘grovelled’ for forgiveness. Woody explained that Laura was quite compassionate about the whole thing and the couple is very much together. Woody even made a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">film</a> on his terrible experience in London called Lost in London in 2017.</p><h2><strong>Laura and Woody Are Parents To 3 Girls They Call “The Goddess Trilogy”</strong></h2><p>Laura and Woody had first met in 1987, meaning that they have been together for 36 years and counting. It is interesting to note that all their children who are all girls were born before the duo even got married. But this didn’t stop the couple from having a blissful relationship and running their businesses together. Laura Louie and her husband Woody Harrelson fondly refer to their daughters as the goddess trilogy.</p><h3><strong>Deni Montana </strong><strong>Harrelson</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: February 28, 1993</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 30 years old</li></ul><p>Their first daughter Deni Montana was born on February 28, 1993, while the couple were yet to be married. Deni was kept away from public eyes and was even homeschooled as a young child. Apart from a few rare appearances on the red carpet with her father, she has mostly stayed out of the limelight.</p><h3><strong>Zoe Giordano </strong><strong>Harrelson</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: September 22, 1996</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 27 years old</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/woody-harrelson-kids-2-1024x683-1.png><p>Their second daughter Zoe Giordano was born on September 22, 1996. Similar to her older sister, she was homeschooled as well and raised out of the limelight. The 27 years old, who largely lives a very private life, made an appearance with her father in a short film, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>U2: Song for Someone</a> in 2015. She also once led a Ted Talk at her high school, where she spoke on the necessity of reducing the dependence on phones.</p><h3><strong>Makani Ravello Harrelson</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: June 3, 2006</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 17 years old</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/pjimage-4.jpg><p>Their youngest daughter, Makani Ravello Harrelson, was born a full decade after her sister Zoe. Makani Ravello was born on June 3, 2006, and is now 17 years old. She appears to be following in her father’s footsteps as she has already made her debut as an actress. She debuted in LBJ in 2016 as a crowd member and in 2017 she played the role of Deni in Lost in London.</p><h2><strong>Laura Louie Built Her Career Alongside Woody Harrelson</strong></h2><p>Laura started off her career working as a personal assistant for her husband Woody Harrelson. When the two got together, she left the job of an assistant. In the mid-’90s, she co-founded Yoganics, an organic grocery delivery service with her friend Konda Mason. Woody Harrelson, who was by then her live-in partner, helped in financing the business.</p><p>Yoganics started off small, but by 1996, it had grown to make deliveries of over 300 boxes every week. Yoganics has attracted select clientele like Brad Pitt, Helen Hunt, and Oliver Stone. With Yoganics, Laura hopes to promote healthy and clean eating, as well as make organic produce easily accessible to people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/76601746_10.jpg><p>Laura Louie, along with her husband, also started a company in 2001 called <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Voice Yourself,</a> which aims to encourage people to embrace sustainable living. The website offers diet advice and vegan recipes using fresh produce as well as encourages people to protest pollution.
