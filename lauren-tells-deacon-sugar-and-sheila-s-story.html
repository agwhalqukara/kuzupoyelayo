It’s insane but true. Deacon concludes that he was right. “I’m not crazy after all. I did see Sheila’s face and ten toes.” They go over it as Deacon question how this is even possible to accomplish this through plastic surgery. Lauren agrees that it’s mind-blowing. She tears up and Deacon says, “She really did a number on you, didn’t she?” Lauren nods — for months, years. She was so happy the nightmare ended with Steffy. Deacon realizes that thanks to him, now it hasn’t. This is why she has to tell him everything she knows about Sheila and Sugar.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Deacon-Lauren-BB-CBS_3bcdf8.jpg alt="Deacon Lauren B&B" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At Forrester, Steffy tells Liam that Deacon is delusional, and she told him that the other day. There’s no way Sheila is still alive! Liam worries this is wearing Steffy down. She says she’s fine, but is frustrated that Deacon won’t let them get on with their lives. “I just want to be done with Sheila once and for all.”</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>B&B’s crazy quotes and bad dialogue</a></p><p>At the cliff house, Hope supposes her father is in a lot of pain if he’s saying these bizarare things. Finn’s sure he’ll realize the truth eventually. Hope asks how Finn is doing. “How would you feel if, against all odds, my father was right about Sheila?”<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Hope-BB-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Hope says she’s not trying to put him on the spot, but she can’t help but wonder if some part of him wishes Sheila were still alive. The go over how complicated it is and Hope recaps that Finn didn’t know who his birth mother was for the majority of his life before finding out it was… her. Finn says Sheila did terrible things and he shouldn’t have any feelings for her, but he’s always felt a connection. He’d never want her dead; stabbed to death by his wife.</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Preview: Deacon gets a lead on Sheila</a></p><p>At Forrester, Steffy complains that it’s like Sheila is still pulling strings from beyond the grave and Deacon is helping. Liam knows Steffy needs this behind her. He reminds her she can’t hurt her or her family anymore, no matter how much Deacon rants. He’d suggest she cut the guy some slack because he’s grieving, but his actions are hurting her. “This applies to Finn too.” Steffy says that Finn is Sheila’s biological son, but that’s all it’s ever going to be. Sheila will never touch their lives again.</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>KKL says Brooke is ready for next rival</a></p><p>At the restaurant, Lauren tells Deacon that he has no idea what Sheila put her through. He’s knows a lot of it. Lauren informs him he doesn’t know everything, and she can’t understand how he could let a woman like her into his life. Deacon needs to understand about Sugar. Lauren explains how Sheila took Sugar to South America and had the plastic surgeon make her look just like her. She bragged about it when they were trapped together. Deacon thought he was going crazy, but now he’s convinced the body he saw getting torched was Sugar, not Sheila.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Deacon-Lauren-2-BB-CBS.jpg alt="Deacon Lauren" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At the cliff house, Hope assures Finn it’s not crazy not to want his birth mother dead. Feelings are complicated and don’t always make sense. Finn recaps that she wasn’t a part of his life and he was raised by two loving parents who always wanted the best for him. When Sheila appeared on his wedding day, for those few moments he was unaware of the history, he was thrilled. “It was like having all the pieces of the puzzle finally.” Hope thinks that makes sense. Finn says it doesn’t make sense that he could still feel anything for Sheila when she almost took everything that mattered to him. “My wife, my mom, my little boy was almost an orphan because of her.” Whatever his feelings for Sheila now or then, they aren’t important compared to the importance of Steffy and his kids’ happiness.</p><p>At Forrester, Steffy and Liam recap Sheila shooting her and Finn and turning their lives upside-down, and then avoiding justice. “Until the night I grabbed a knife and defended myself.” Liam thinks she can relax now and doesn’t have to constantly look over her shoulder. Steffy admits it’s a huge relief. “Deacon is an idiot if she actually thinks Sheila’s alive.”<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liam-Steffy-BB-CBS_f59a43.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At the restaurant, Deacon guesses that the Sheila and Sugar stuff happened quite a while ago. Lauren says that Sugar got busted when she attacked her son Scott. She loved him too much, so it didn’t make sense. She went to visit her and that’s when she realized that the woman didn’t have Sheila’s limp. The fingerprints didn’t match — it was Sugar, who confessed everything. She gave up everything for Sheila: her face, her freedom. Deacon guesses that’s why Sugar had it out for Sheila. Lauren replies, “That’s exactly what I’m saying.”</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Don Diamont gets ‘crabby’</a></p><p>At the cliff house, Hope teases Finn that he’s up for the father and husband of the year nomination. Finn asks if she thinks Liam deserves a nod. Hope says he falls short on husband of the year. Finn loves being married to Steffy and being the father of two splendiferous kids. They laugh over Kelly’s new favorite word. Hope marvels at how he delights in his children. He’s a good man and Steffy should know how lucky he is to have him.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Finn-BB-CBS_f36572.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At Forrester, Steffy assumes Liam needs to get back to Spencer. She doesn’t want to waste his time talking about Sheila. Liam will listen to her talk about anything, anytime. He relays how he’s trying to be the best father and man he can be right now. Steffy thinks he’s terrific just the way they are. Liam thanks her and recaps that they spent a long time together. They were extremely close and fiercely in love. That kind of love doesn’t just die.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liam-Steffy-header-BB-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Scott Clifton teases how [Spoiler] could wipe the slate clean</a></p><p>At Il Giardino, Lauren tells Deacon that Sugar is still in prison for her crimes. “But if you’re asking me if Sugar despises Sheila? 100%” She set her up to go to prison for her crimes. She definitely would have been dreaming about revenge on Sheila. Deacon muses, “Unless…” He asks for Sugar’s real name. Lauren says, “Janet Webber.” She laments that she was so glad that Sheila was dead. She hopes he’s wrong, that his eyes were playing tricks on him, and that it was Sheila who was cremated. With that, she leaves. Deacon walks back over to his laptop and agonizes, “Sheila, what happened to you?!”<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Deacon-end-BB-CBS_60662f.jpg alt="Deacon end" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Casting news!
